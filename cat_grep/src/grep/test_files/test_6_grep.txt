grep  searches  for  PATTERNS  in  each  FILE.  PATTERNS is one or more
patterns separated by newline characters, and  grep  prints  each  line
that  matches a pattern.  Typically PATTERNS should be quoted when grep
is used in a shell command.

A FILE of “-”  stands  for  standard  input.   If  no  FILE  is  given,
recursive  searches  examine  the  working  directory, and nonrecursive
searches read standard input.

In addition, the variant programs egrep, fgrep and rgrep are  the  same
as  grep -E,  grep -F,  and  grep -r, respectively.  These variants are
deprecated, but are provided for backward compatibility.
